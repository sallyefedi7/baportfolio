									<h2>Improving Contact Management Efficiency with Salesforce for National Urban Fellows, Washington DC, US - cont'd</h2>
									<span class="image main"><img src="images/edu 2.jpg" alt="" /></span>
									<p><h3>Project Description</h3>
										I led a project to enhance a client's contact management system, achieving an 80% improvement in efficiency. The client's existing system suffered from inconsistent, unreliable, and disorganized data, which negatively impacted contact engagement, donor revenue, and compliance with data regulations.
										
										To address these issues, I conducted thorough business research to understand their processes and organizational structure. I identified pain points and gaps in the current system and collaborated with both business and technical teams to design an improved contact management system using Salesforce. This involved migrating data from all siloed sources and automating most business processes.</p>

										<p><h3>Project Achievements</h3>
											
Successful implementation and configuration of new Salesforce org from scratch. <br />										

Achieving 100% success in all data migrations. <br />

Attaining a 90% score from the Salesforce Health Checker, which assesses the overall security health of the organization.<br />

Automating business processes and configuring major reports and dashboards on Salesforce. <br />

Securing stakeholder sign-off.<br /> </p>

<p><h3>Project Retrospective</h3>
	This project not only met stakeholders' expectations for data integration and process improvement but also enhanced my skills in data migration and data-driven decision-making while working with cross-functional teams and CRM software deployment.</p>

									<h2>Enhancing Community Building through Ancestry Data Integration for The Multicultural Innovation Center, Rhode Island, US - cont'd</h2>
									<span class="image main"><img src="images/aamerica 3.jpg" alt="" /></span>
									<p><h3>Project Description</h3>
									I led a project to develop a feature for managing ancestry and genealogy data of the Native American population in North-Eastern United States. The Multicultural Innovation Center, a non-profit based in Rhode Island, aimed to preserve Native American culture and history by tracking and documenting information from as far back as 1800s and 1900s. This initiative was designed to help living descendants trace their ancestors and foster community building within Native American communities.

										The existing website, which served as the data gathering tool, had several inadequacies that impeded community building efforts. To address these issues, I conducted business process mapping to understand the current process of gathering and managing contacts. I identified areas for improvement and collaborated with business and technical teams to define business requirements.
										
										I partnered with the US team to contact state and federal government agencies to gather recorded ancestral data while ensuring compliance with all required data regulations. I led the initial deployment of Salesforce for Nonprofits, contact data migration and automating business processes. Additionally, I integrated the website with Salesforce to enable more efficient data transfer.</p>

							

									<p><h3>Project Achievements</h3>
										
								
										Increasing community building efforts and gathering more ancestry information due to an improved website.<br />
										
										Enhancing revenue through wider-reaching initiatives and better data management.<br />
										
										Broadening my experience in working with non-profits, social sectors, and governmental agencies.<br /> </p>

<p><h3>Project Retrospective</h3>
	This project not only met the stakeholders' expectations but also significantly improved my skills in data migration, process automation, and cross-functional collaboration</p>
